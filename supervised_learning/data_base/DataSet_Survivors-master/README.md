DataScience_Survivors_Titanic
=================

Short program written for Data Science studies at Udacity.  

Highest recorded (from posted results) accuracy at the time this repo was created -- 80.81% accuracy.
The goal was 80% and the highest before I posted was just over that.

Language -- Python

API -- Pandas (data science package)

Code summary: Filtered by several passenger characteristics (gender, age, class, family size, etc) from sample passenger manifest of the Titanic.  Very sad, but very interesting.

Original file format is CSV.  Data set file and other info on variables used in this project is commented within the code itself.
